# k-means

# The K-means algorithm is a method to automatically cluster similar data points together.
#
# Concretely, you are given a training set  {𝑥(1),...,𝑥(𝑚)}
#  , and you want to group the data into a few cohesive “clusters”.
# K-means is an iterative procedure that
# Starts by guessing the initial centroids, and then
# Refines this guess by
# Repeatedly assigning examples to their closest centroids, and then
# Recomputing the centroids based on the assignments.
# In pseudocode, the K-means algorithm is as follows:
#
#   # Initialize centroids
#   # K is the number of clusters
#   centroids = kMeans_init_centroids(X, K)
#
#   for iter in range(iterations):
#       # Cluster assignment step:
#       # Assign each data point to the closest centroid.
#       # idx[i] corresponds to the index of the centroid
#       # assigned to example i
#       idx = find_closest_centroids(X, centroids)
#
#       # Move centroid step:
#       # Compute means based on centroid assignments
#       centroids = compute_centroids(X, idx, K)
# The inner-loop of the algorithm repeatedly carries out two steps:
# Assigning each training example  𝑥(𝑖)
#   to its closest centroid, and
# Recomputing the mean of each centroid using the points assigned to it.
# The  𝐾
#  -means algorithm will always converge to some final set of means for the centroids.
#
# However, the converged solution may not always be ideal and depends on the initial setting of the centroids.
#
# Therefore, in practice the K-means algorithm is usually run a few times with different random initializations.
# One way to choose between these different solutions from different random initializations is to choose the one with the lowest cost function value (distortion).


# 1.1 Finding closest centroids
# In the “cluster assignment” phase of the K-means algorithm, the algorithm assigns every training example  𝑥(𝑖)
#   to its closest centroid, given the current positions of centroids.


# Your task is to complete the code in find_closest_centroids.
